# tilefish

A typed tensor language for GPU inference: shapes, dtypes, layouts and
quantization formats in the type, one build into GPU binaries, and generated
Python, C++ and Rust hosts.

**Status: early preview.** This release type-checks: tensor types and
block-scaled formats (MXFP8, MXFP4, NVFP4), `extern` / `library` / `kernel` /
`graph` declarations, tracing into a typed IR, and Triton ahead-of-time
compile specs for `extern` kernels. Pure Python, no dependencies. Nothing is
lowered to Triton or compiled yet, and the API will change.

The design and the roadmap are at https://github.com/Kilerd/tilefish.
