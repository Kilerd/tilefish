# tilefish

A typed tensor language for GPU inference: shapes, dtypes, layouts and
quantization formats in the type, one build into GPU binaries, and generated
Python, C++ and Rust hosts.

**Status: early preview.** This release type-checks: tensor types and
block-scaled formats (MXFP8, MXFP4, NVFP4), `extern` / `library` / `kernel` /
`graph` declarations, tracing into a typed IR, and Triton ahead-of-time
compile specs for `extern` kernels. Pure Python, no dependencies. A `@kernel`
also lowers to Triton source (`tilefish.lower`), and with the `gpu` extra
(`pip install "tilefish[gpu]"`: torch, Triton, cuda-python) a spec builds into
a cubin (`tilefish.aot.build`) and a kernel runs in `jit`, `replay` and
`reference` mode (`tilefish.run`). The API will change.

The design and the roadmap are at https://github.com/Kilerd/tilefish.
